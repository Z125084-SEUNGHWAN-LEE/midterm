                        <p>This project is a 3D model of a guitar workshop, designed to capture the atmosphere of a handcrafted instrument studio. The goal was to create a realistic and detailed space that reflects the tools, materials, and vibe of a traditional luthier’s workspace.</p>

                        <p>This project features a 3D model of a one-man band robot — a whimsical, multi-instrument-playing machine designed to perform music on its own. The goal was to combine mechanical elements with playful character design, capturing both function and personality.</p>

                        <h3>Running Animation Using Rotoscoping</h3>
                        <p>For this project, I created an animation of a person running by using the rotoscoping technique. By tracing over live-action footage frame by frame, I aimed to capture realistic movement with a hand-drawn feel. This exercise helped me better understand motion and timing in animation.</p>

                        <p>In this project, I created a stop-motion animation using action figures as characters. By carefully moving the figures frame by frame, I brought a small-scale story to life. This hands-on approach taught me patience and precision in animation production.
